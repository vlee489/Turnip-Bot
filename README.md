## Support Me!
Servers cost money, if you want to give me a hand you can throw me some spare change over at
[Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/vlee489).

## Self-Host (*Not Ready*)
Currently Documentation is still being written, and the Turnip prediction code is yet to be made public.
*It's a mess and needs a rewrite before being made public, but is based off of* 
[nanoNago's *"library"*](https://gitlab.com/nanoNago/turnips).

Requirements
- Server with the following
    - Python 3.8 or newer
    - AWS Command Line Interface (*& configured*)
    - pip3.8
- AWS DynamoDB noSQL database
- AWS S3 Bucket *or* Digital Ocean Spaces
