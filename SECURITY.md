The prefered way of disclosing Security Vulnerability via GitHub's builit in secuity feature over 
at the [Security Tab](https://github.com/vlee489/Turnip-Bot/security/advisories).
A reply will usually be given within 48 hours of disclosure, with a time frame to correct issues
or 30 days or less.

During this 30 day period Security advisories should stay as a draft to give adiquate time to correct
the issue at hand. After this 30 day period or when the issue is patches (*Which ever comes first*), 
the Security advisories may then be published along with the related patches.

Another way of disclosing issues is directly DMing Vincent/vlee489#5801
