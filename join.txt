Hello there :wave:

I'm Turnip Bot, I'm the general-purpose Animal Crossing bot.

To get started with me use `<help` to find out what commands I have, but here's a rundown of my categories.

- **Turnips** This category of commands are used to add data to create turnip predictions.
   `<setBuyPrice`: Used to set the price you bought the turnips on Sunday on **your** island
   `<ap`: Used for setting the price you can sell turnips for day to day on your island
   `<tsg`: Gets a graphed Turnip Summary/Predictions of your prices.
   `<ts`: Gets a text Turnip Summary/Predictions of your prices.
- **Lookup** (*In Beta*) This category of commands can be used to lookup thing from Animal Crossing
   `<villager`: Look up a villager
   `<critter`: Lookup bugs and fish
   `<fossils`: Look up fossils
   `<diy`: Lookup a DIY recipe
